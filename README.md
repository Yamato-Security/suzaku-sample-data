# Suzaku Sample Data

This repository contains various cloud logs containing attack data.
This is to be used to test detection capabilities with [Suzaku](https://github.com/Yamato-Security/suzaku).

The data is gathered from the following sources:
 - [Invictus-ir dataset](https://www.invictus-ir.com/nieuws/automated-first-response-in-aws-using-sigma-and-athena): In August 2023, Invictus-ir did great research on simulating 32 attacks against AWS with the [Stratus Red Team](https://github.com/DataDog/stratus-red-team) tool to compare detections with Sigma, Athena and Splunk rules and shared [the dataset](https://github.com/invictus-ir/aws_dataset) after the attacks.
 - [Flaws.cloud dataset](https://summitroute.com/downloads/flaws_cloudtrail_logs.tar): Scott Piper from Summit Route made his public data from attacks against his free [flaws.cloud](http://flaws.cloud/) training website in 2020. (Note that the IP addresses and accound IDs have been anonymized as explained [here](https://summitroute.com/blog/2020/10/09/public_dataset_of_cloudtrail_logs_from_flaws_cloud/).)
 - [SANS 504 S3 Ransomware Lab](https://www.sans.org/cyber-security-courses/hacker-techniques-incident-handling/): This dataset comes from a simulated S3 ransomware scenario that was used in a previous lab. This is released with permission from course author [Josh Wright](https://github.com/joswr1ght).
 - [Stratus Red Team](https://stratus-red-team.cloud/): A great project by [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/) that simulates cloud attacks. Logs are automatically generated by [Grimoire](https://github.com/DataDog/grimoire) and anonymized by [LogLicker](https://github.com/Permiso-io-tools/LogLicker).
 - [Traildiscover.cloud](https://traildiscover.cloud/): A great website that lists up all of the AWS API calls used in attacks and provides sample JSON data.
